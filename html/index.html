            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <article>
                <h2>My values</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>I am a passionate person</h3>
                        <p>I do my best, doing my work with love and purpose. Subsequently, I will go above and beyond expectations to do the work. For example, I put in as much effort as I can in the FED assignment to fulfil all requirements.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>I am resilient and a hard worker</h3>
                        <p>I do not give up, and I put as much work as I can to succeed. Even if the task is overdemanding, unfair and too challenging, I will improve my skills to become more skilled and fit to complete it, like I did for the FED assignment task.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>I am a righteous person</h3>
                        <p>I will try to act accordingly to good morals at all times, so that my work can have the best effect on the surrounding environment, for example I made sure to be honest and only use code I wrote or understood.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My interests and personality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>A big tech fan</h3>
                        <p>Tech is one of my passions and it's getting more and more interesting. It is one of the few areas which keep on growing. I am a fan of both the programming sector and the tech fabrication sector. For example the laptop I am typing on is one I researched heavily to be the best for me.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Watching Youtube videos</h3>
                        <p>Youtube, just like tech, has so many new stuff to look at all the time, there is always something to watch. However, I developed a love-hate relationship with this at it takes up too many hours of my day for no reward. This is because it is too addictive and I should regulate my use of it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Playing Rubik's Cubes</h3>
                        <p>I used to be very passionate about this, solving the cube hundreds of times per day. I was a speedcuber, trying to solve the cube as fast as possible. While I've had a falling out of this hobby, I am plannning to get back into it with blindfolded solving for memory sports.</p>

                <h2>My personality</h2>
                <p>
                    To summarise my personality, I would describe myself as a fun and easy-going person, who enjoys jokes. I'm fairly imaginative, always trying to think outside the box. I am someone who really likes novelty above all else, and doesn't mind a challenge either. I enjoy talking with others, while also enjoying solace and retrospection.
